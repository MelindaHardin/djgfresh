        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          A connoisseur of music with 15+ years of experience, 'The Ambassador' DJ
          Guaranteed-Fresh (G-FRESH) serves people through creative styles and
          sounds that move, captivate and enrich the body and spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          In college, G-FRESH operated as promotions director and on air talent
          with the #1 college show in the city. Described as a young man with an
          'old soul', G-FRESH discovered a penchant of controlling crowds through
          uniquely blended musical experiences paired with energy capturing
          performances. G-FRESH served as the chair of entertainment at his
          university and helped build streaming services to engage listeners
          locally and abroad. Through this work, G-FRESH built a network of
          contacts and resources to bring a dynamic variety of events to campus,
          and was able to collaborate with community organizations and other
          business institutions around the Mid-West region. These 'technics'
          helped 'The Ambassador' establish a name for himself and as a result of
          this work, G-FRESH became a founding member of the KYMP Kamp DJ's,
          Kentucky's 1st DJ coalition. G-FRESH operated as a member within its
          executive board, working to strengthen the relationship between the DJ,
          artist, music, and fans. The KYMP Kamp DJ family grew and evovolved into
          The ELITEgiance, which G-FRESH remains a proud member.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following years of successful club DJ residencies, promoter ventures and
          business partnerships within the Teen/College/Club/Corporate/Wedding
          circuits throughout the Mid-West and Mid-South, G-FRESH relocated to
          South Florida to amass a wider knowledgebase of musical styles and be
          infused into the same land as some of the world's greatest performers.
          During this time, G-FRESH became exclusively tailored to
          Private/Corporate clientele and was privileged to work alongside an
          amazing family of DJs and producers at Scratch DJ Academy in Miami,
          Florida, teaching basic skills on the art of becoming a DJ to people all
          over the world.
